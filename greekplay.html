    <h3 style="color:green;">"PHILOCTETES" by Sophocles</h3>
    <p style="color: red;">Enter ODYSSEUS.</p>
    <b>ODYSSEUS</b><br>
    What art thou doing, knave?
    Give me that bow, and haste thee back again.<br>

    <b>PHI.</b><br>
    Alas! What do I hear? Odysseus’ voice?<br>

    <b>OD.</b><br>
    Be sure of that, Odysseus, whom thou seest.<br>

    <b>PHI.</b><br>
    Oh, I am bought and sold, undone! ’Twas he
    That kidnapped me, and robbed me of my bow.<br>

    <b>ODYSSEUS.</b><br>
    Yea. I deny it not. Be sure, ’twas I.<br>

    <b>PHI.</b><br>
    Give back, my son, the bow; release it!<br>

    <b>ODYSSEUS.</b><br>
    That,
    Though he desire it, he shall never do.
    Thou too shalt march along, or these shall force thee.<br>

    <b>PHI.</b><br>
    They force me! O thou boldest of bad men!
    They force me?<br>

    <b>ODYSSEUS.</b><br>
    If thou com’st not willingly.<br>
